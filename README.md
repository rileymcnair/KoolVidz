Our team plans to implement a video sharing service to provide information and entertainment to users. 
This includes a search bar, like/dislike system, and a top videos page.

Planned Features:

● Display Dynamic Data to the User

  ○ The website will display video titles, videos, and comments based on user
selection.

● Upload data from Client to Back-end

  ○ Users will be able to upload videos and associated information which will be stored on the server.
  
● Meaningfully search through server-side data

  ○ Users will be able to search for video titles using a search bar.
  
  ○ Searches will sort by most relevant first.
  
● Unique Feature #1: View Counter

  ○ The number of times a video has been viewed will be displayed, allowing
    users to determine the popularity of a video.
    
● Unique Feature #2: Video Rating System (Like/Dislike)

  ○ Users will be able to like and dislike videos.
  
  ○ Like count and like to dislike ratio will be displayed on videos.
  
● Unique Feature #3: Comments Section

  ○ Users will submit comments which will be stored on the server database.
  
  ○ Comments will be associated with and displayed under a video.
