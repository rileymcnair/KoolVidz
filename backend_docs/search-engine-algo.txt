Search Engine Algorithm:

1. Exact match title
    - If video title contains the exact search string
2. Exact match description
    - If description contains the exact search string
3. Word combinations title
    - Split search string by whitespace into words
    - Limit the number of words to avoid excessive complexity
    - Generate all combinations of words
    - Search for each combination
    - Example: search_str == "funny cat videos"
        - contains "funny" and contains "cat" and contains "videos"
        - contains "cat" and contains "videos"
        - contains "funny" and contains "videos"
        - contains "funny" and contains "cat"
        - contains "funny"
        - contains "cat"
        - contains "videos"
4. Word combinations description
    - Do the same as #3 but search video description instead
5. Remove duplicates
